Wk9 hw:  Looping and branching code: at least five branches that you can diagram.

Copy-paste your example into "homework-6.1.md" and attempt to identify the loop conditions with comments e.g.


while ( count < 5 ) {

// while `count` is less than 5


collection.forEach(function(item){
// until there are no more `items` in the `collection`


//The following are examples.  Just give me five different examples of this code written out.

Example:

for (var key in object) {
    //do stuff with object[key]
}


var animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'bear'];
animals.forEach(function(animal, index) {
    alert(index + ':' + animal); // '0:dog', '1:cat', '2:bear'
});
